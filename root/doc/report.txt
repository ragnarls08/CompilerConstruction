shift reduce conflict in if else..
	the famous dangling else problem! 

http://ezekiel.vancouver.wsu.edu/~cs355/lectures/syntax-semantics/synsem.pdf

In practice, the dangling-else ambiguity is intentionally left unresolved in the language's grammar;
explicitly xing the grammar (as above) makes the grammar less readable. It is assumed that
the programmer and language implementor is aware of the ambiguity and knows how resolve
the problem. A good example is the grammar listed in the appendix the famous Kernighan and
Ritchie book The C Programming Language.
